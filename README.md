# CUE for Visual Studio Code

[The VS Code CUE
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cuelangorg.vscode-cue)
provides rich language support for [the CUE language](https://cuelang.org/)
through syntax highlighting and language server integration.

## What is CUE?

CUE makes it easy to validate data, write schemas, and ensure configurations
align with policies.

CUE works with a wide range of tools and formats that you're already using such
as Go, JSON, YAML, OpenAPI, and JSON Schema.

For more information and documentation, including __tutorials and guides__, see
[cuelang.org](https://cuelang.org).

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have
   [CUE installed](https://cuelang.org/docs/introduction/installation/) on the
   computer that's running VS Code. We recommend installing the latest version.

1. Install the
   [VS Code CUE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cuelangorg.vscode-cue).

1. Open any CUE file to automatically activate the extension. The CUE
   status bar appears in the bottom right corner of the window and displays your
   CUE version. The :zap: sign next to the CUE version indicates the language
   server is running, and you are ready to go.

1. Use the Command Palette, `Shift+Command+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   (Windows/Linux), to run CUE-specific commands. Find them through their
   common `CUE: ` prefix.

## Feedback

Whether you're new to CUE, or an experienced user, we hope this extension fits
your needs and enhances your configuration, data and policy experience.

Please give us feedback through GitHub [issues](https://cuelang.org/issues) and
[discussions](https://cuelang.org/discussions) in the main CUE repo - we really
value your input, experiences with the extension, and ideas!
