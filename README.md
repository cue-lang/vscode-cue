# CUE for Visual Studio Code

[The VS Code CUE
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cuelangorg.vscode-cue)
provides rich language support for the [CUE language](https://cuelang.org/).

## What is CUE?

CUE makes it easy to validate data, write schemas, and ensure configurations
align with policies.

CUE works with a wide range of tools and formats that you're already using such
as Go, JSON, YAML, OpenAPI, and JSON Schema.

For more information and documentation, including __tutorials and guides__, see
[cuelang.org](https://cuelang.org).

## Why is this extension useful?

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an awesome, extensible,
multi-platform editor and IDE. Its ecosystem has a massive number of plugins for
different languages, and this one implements syntax highlighting (and
potentially more functionality in the future) for the CUE language.

## Quick Start

Whether you are new or experienced CUE user, we hope this extension fits your
needs and enhances your configuration, data and policy experience.

1. Install [CUE](https://cuelang.org/docs/introduction/installation/) v0.11.0 or
   newer if you haven't already.

1. Install the [VS Code CUE extension].

1. Open any CUE file file to automatically activate the extension. The CUE
   status bar appears in the bottom right corner of the window and displays your
   CUE version. The :zap: sign next to the CUE version indicates the language
   server is running, and you are ready to go.

1. Use the Command Palette, `Shift+Command+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   (Windows/Linux), to run CUE-specific commands. They are all prefixed with
   `CUE:`.

## Credits

This project was started by [betawaffle](https://github.com/betawaffle) who
graciously permitted that it be moved to a more general home in the
[cue-sh](https://github.com/cue-sh) (which is part of the [CUE
Project](https://cuelang.org)), before then being migrated to the
[cue-lang](https://github.com/cue-lang) organisation which more clearly
identifies it as part of the CUE Project along with the [main CUE
repository](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue).
