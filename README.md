# CUE for Visual Studio Code

[The official VS Code CUE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cuelangorg.vscode-cue)
provides rich language support for
[the CUE language](https://cuelang.org/)
through syntax highlighting and language server (LSP) integration.

## What is CUE?

CUE makes it easy to validate data, write schemas, and ensure configurations
align with policies.

CUE works with a wide range of tools and formats that you're already using such
as Go, JSON, YAML, OpenAPI, and JSON Schema.

For more information and documentation, including __tutorials and guides__, see
[cuelang.org](https://cuelang.org).

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have
   [CUE installed](https://cuelang.org/docs/introduction/installation/) on the
   computer that's running VS Code. We recommend installing the latest version.

1. Install the
   [VS Code CUE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cuelangorg.vscode-cue).

1. Open any CUE file to automatically activate the extension. The CUE
   status bar appears in the bottom right corner of the window and displays your
   CUE version. The :zap: sign next to the CUE version indicates the language
   server is running, and you are ready to go.

1. Use the Command Palette, `Shift+Command+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   (Windows/Linux), to run CUE-specific commands. Find them through their
   common `CUE: ` prefix.

## Feedback

We welcome feedback on your experience with the extension.
Please file bug reports and share ideas via
