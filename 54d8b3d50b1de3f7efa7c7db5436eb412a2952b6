      "message": "this makes me nervous. exec.Run runs a program with arguments, and not a shell script, so the `\u0026\u0026` here is literlaly being printed as an argument to /bin/echo rather than causing any if/then bash logic.\n\nso I think this is silently not doint what you expect? I think you need to either call `bash -c one_string_argument`, or rework this logic so that shell isn\u0027t needed.\n\nprobably best to test this command with both the positive and negative scenarios to double check it does what we intend.",

So I\u0027ll simply remove the `\u0026\u0026 false` bit because it fails for exactly the reason you described.\n\nI\u0027ve also raised a question about a `false`-equivalent stdlib task that could/should be part of `cuelang.org/go/pkg/tool/...` somewhere. I\u0027ll raise an issue and link to that issue from the task below.\n\nI have also updated this task to be a simple print with string interpolation.",
