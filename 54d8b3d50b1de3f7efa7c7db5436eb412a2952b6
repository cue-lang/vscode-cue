      "message": "this makes me nervous. exec.Run runs a program with arguments, and not a shell script, so the `\u0026\u0026` here is literlaly being printed as an argument to /bin/echo rather than causing any if/then bash logic.\n\nso I think this is silently not doint what you expect? I think you need to either call `bash -c one_string_argument`, or rework this logic so that shell isn\u0027t needed.\n\nprobably best to test this command with both the positive and negative scenarios to double check it does what we intend.",
